this is a simple "terminal" where you can enter a username and password (anything will work) and with the "wordlist.txt" file you can search for anything in there and it will pop up
just click code and "download zip file" then extract it, also you can use any txt file you just have to name it "wordlist.txt" for with the txt already in the folder put anything you want in there
